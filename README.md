# React-Video_Website

* this is a simple impletation of our design with a Homepage and a UploadPage with simple MongoDB Setup

The website was built by carefully designing and integrating key features like the Header, Video Display, Video Player, Comment Section, Upload Functionality, Sidebar, and Admin Dashboard. Using React's modular design made each component reusable and adaptable for future needs. MongoDB was chosen as the database for its scalability and reliability. Robust search functionality using Elasticsearch or Algolia improved user experience, while features like the comment section encouraged community interaction. Personalized recommendations through machine learning were also explored. Throughout development, addressing risks like scalability and security was a priority, with strategies like horizontal scaling and strict security measures in place. Overall, the implementation created a user-friendly website ready to deliver an outstanding browsing experience.
